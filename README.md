**Objective**
The Objective of this task is to develop a tool that assesses the strength of passwords entered by users. It implements algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide feedback on password strength.

**How it works?**
**i)** Checks whether the password entered by user has lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits and special characters. 
**ii)** The Button "Register" will function(take the user to the next activity) only when the password entered by the user is Bulletproof which means that it consists of more that 10 characters and has all the required conditions as mentioned above.
**iii)** Once every condition is fulfilled, for ex, if the user has entered a lowercase letter, the "✓ Lowercase Letters" will change to the colour green. 
**iv)** There are 4 stages of the password : Weak(0-4 characters), medium(5-7 characters), strong(8-10 characters) and bulletproof(more than 10 characters)
